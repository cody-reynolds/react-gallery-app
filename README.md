# react-gallery-app
 An image gallery app using React and the MVC framework

This is a photo search app that uses React and the Flickr API.  The user can click on navigational links that show them the results of photo search for various keywords, and search for their own keywords in the search box.

The purpose of this project was to get some experience starting from Create-React-App, building components, passing down data stored in Application state as props, and rendering components conditionally using React-Router.

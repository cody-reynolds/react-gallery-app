# react-gallery-app

*Description*
This is a photo search app that uses React and the Flickr API.  The user can click on navigational links that show them the results of photo search for various keywords, and search for their own keywords in the search box.

The purpose of this project was to get some experience starting from Create-React-App, building components, passing down data stored in Application state as props, and rendering components conditionally using React-Router.

*Instructions*
In order to make this app work, you will need to store a Flickr API key by creating a file in the components folder called config.js. It only requires 2 lines:

const apiKey = 'API KEY GOES HERE';
export default apiKey;

Once the API key is loaded, and you have installed the project's dependencies with "npm install", you can start up the project by typing in "npm start" in the terminal.

This project was created as part of the [Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/full-stack-javascript).
